## Introduction

## Project Description
A website where people/users looking for a laborer of some kind (landscaper, painter, etc) can browse different laborer profiles and examine their services, rates, and whatever else. there will also be a "reviews" section where a machine learning model interprets the reviews and breaks them down into good, neutral, and bad.
## Project Features/Requirements
Database Integration - We will be using MySql Workbench to harbor csv files to do SQL commands. We will be utilizing a api, either MangoDB or XAMP, to handle read and writes to data. Data will be pooled using a web scraping library like Beautiful Soup in Python.
