Project Description: A website where people/users looking for a laborer of some kind (landscaper, painter, etc) can browse different laborer profiles and examine their services, rates, and whatever else. there will also be a "reviews" section where a machine learning model interprets the reviews and breaks them down into good, neutral, and bad.
